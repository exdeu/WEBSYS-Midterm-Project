Bulasan Spring, often called **Linaw Spring**, is a well-known natural spring located in the heart of Argao, Cebu. It features crystal-clear, cool water flowing into a man-made pool surrounded by concrete walls for swimming and bathing. The name “Linaw” means “clear” in Cebuano, reflecting the spring’s transparent and refreshing water.

The area blends natural beauty with a simple community setup — local houses, plants, and resting spots nearby create a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. It serves as a favorite gathering place for locals who come to swim, cool off, and enjoy the clean, natural water source.
