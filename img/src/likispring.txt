Liki Spring (Liki Cold Spring) in Taloot, Argao, Cebu is a natural cold spring where clear, refreshing water flows from a rock crack—hence the name “Liki,” meaning “crack” in Cebuano. Surrounded by lush greenery, it offers a peaceful, natural setting ideal for swimming, relaxing, or picnicking. The water is very cold and clean, often used by locals for bathing and washing. It remains largely undeveloped with no entrance fee, only a small parking fee (₱10 for motorcycles, ₱50 for cars), making it a simple yet beautiful nature spot for visitors seeking a quiet escape.
