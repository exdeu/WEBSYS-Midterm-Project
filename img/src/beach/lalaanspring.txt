Lalaan Spring is a natural cold spring tucked within the green hills of Argao, Cebu. The spring’s crystal-clear water flows from a rocky opening at the base of a hillside, forming a small pool where visitors can swim and cool off. Surrounded by tropical plants and trees, the area offers a refreshing and peaceful atmosphere perfect for relaxation.

Concrete steps lead down to the spring, and nearby huts with red metal roofs provide shaded resting spots for families and tourists. Despite its simplicity, Lalaan Spring’s natural charm and cool waters make it a favorite hidden gem for locals and travelers seeking a calm retreat close to nature.
